Budgetizer
==========

A little demi-app to help me streamline my job- and apartment-search process.

My budget spreadsheet was getting a little crowded considering the fact that I needed different values for every place
I was considering moving to. So I built this to allow me to play with potential salaries and apartment prices easily
in various different cities. Obviously the constants I'm using are based on my own spending and can be edited to fit
anyone else's needs (and you can also add new lines to the budget -- they're just elements in arrays).

For calculating the cost of living modifier, use this site: 
http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx

Give wherever you live now a modifier of 1 and adjust that down or up depending on what the cost of living calculator
says the percent difference will be.
